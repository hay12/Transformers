# Transformer Architecture: Attention Is All You Need

## Introduction

- This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer architecture, as proposed in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The original paper can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).
- This repository is based on the Tensorflow code released with the original paper, which is part of the [Tensor2Tensor repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor)

- This Git repository will be followed by an article that will break each part of it and explain it fully.
